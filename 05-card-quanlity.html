camelCase
**********
cartQuantity ===> capitalize every word expect the first word 
# camelCase is the Standard for javaScript

PasacalCase
************
CartQuantity ==> same as camelCase - excpect we capitalize first word

kebab-case 
***********
cart-quantity  ___> doesnt working in javascript but it work in the html file name

snake_case
**********
cart_quantity ___> doesnt working in javascript but used in the other languages

==========================================
Note: in the javascript , let can the change the variable. 
* but in the const it cant change the variable

const variable2 = 3
 variable2 = 5

 ----- it shows an error uncaught typeError Assignment to constant variable.

 let we can use what value inside the variable
 
 ** best practice = use const by default

 var variable3 = 4;
 var like let can change the variable in the we dont use var in new javascript code

 [ Use const by default ]
 [ if we have to change a variable then use let ]
